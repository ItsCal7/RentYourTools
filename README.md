Final Project for my OOP class, Created with Jude Sears (but we didn't use Github while making it)

A tool rental system that uses Excel spreadsheets as a makeshift database to store information about the users (including their login information) and the tools they've rented and returned. 
Admins must manually approve return requests to verify that the tool was both returned and in the condition the user rented it as. 
The idea behind this code is that it could be turned into an app for a tool rental service, but making an app was out of the scope of the project.
